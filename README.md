# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project was to practice my JavaScript skills and DOM manipulation. The game allows two players to play against each other, and can check for a win or a tie. Since this is a simple project, I did not feel the need to use any frameworks.

## Room for improvement
The most challenging part of this project was building the logic to check for when the game is over. While I was able to solve the problem, I feel that I could have come up with a more elegant solution, and therefore had less repetition in my code. If I were to work on this project again, I would like to have included more features, such as allowing players to enter a name, or letting the user choose whether X or O makes the first move. Another feature I would consider adding is creating an AI to play against, using the minimax algorithm.
